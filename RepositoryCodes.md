# Respository Codes

As part of a PSM Provenance Identifier, a variant of the Universal Spectrum Identifier (USI), a repository code MUST be
specified. The range of possible repository codes is listed here in this document so that it may be easily extended without
altering the primary specification document.

Currently permitted repository codes are as follows:

- PR (PRIDE)
- PA (PeptideAtlas)
- MA (MassIVE)
- JP (jPOST)
- IP (iProX)
- PP (Panorama Public).

Repository codes must be presented as capital letters.

Repository codes SHOULD have a P as one of the two letters. JK
